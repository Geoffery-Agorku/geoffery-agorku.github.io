                <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Predicting the Type and Amount of Barges Carried by Vessels on Waterways using Machine Learning</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implemented a novel data collection approach by utilizing five traffic cameras to manually count about 3,862 barges carried by 610 vessels on inland waterways over one year.</li>
                            <li>Utilized Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and trajectory analysis techniques to create detailed vessel trajectories, enabling a deeper understanding of vessel movements and patterns on waterways.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Traffic Cameras to Detect Inland Waterway Barge Traffic: An Application of Machine Learning</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Developed a deep learning model designed to analyze traffic camera feeds and accurately predict the presence of barge traffic on inland waterways, achieving an accuracy rate of 96% on 116 test images.</li>
                            <li>Authored a research paper detailing the project's methodology, findings, and implications, currently under review for publication in the Transportation Research Record (TRR).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Improving Rider Satisfaction and Efficiency of Razorback Transit in Fayetteville, Arkansas</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Designed comprehensive questionnaires aimed at capturing rider feedback and preferences, focusing on enhancing overall satisfaction with Razorback Transit services in Fayetteville.</li>
                            <li>Implemented a beta survey to test the effectiveness and usability of the questionnaires among a sample of riders.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Investigating the Relationship Between Particulate Matter Pollution, Land Use, and Population Growth in Long Beach, California Using GIS</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Leveraged ArcGIS spatial analysis and modeling techniques to create a comprehensive model predicting the relationship between particulate matter (PM) pollution, land use patterns, and population growth in Long Beach, California.</li>
                            <li>Visualized the analysis results using GIS tools, generating 12 maps and reports to effectively communicate complex spatial relationships.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Transportation Engineering Game for K-12 Students</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Conducted extensive research to gain insights into key concepts and principles of Transportation Engineering most relevant and engaging for K-12 students.</li>
                            <li>Created and tested an interactive game challenging about 20 students to solve Transportation Engineering problems, resulting in a positive feedback score of 4.75 and effectively promoting problem-solving skills.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>2023 AI City Challenge - Track 5 (Detecting Violation of Helmet Rule for Motorcyclists)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Employed state-of-the-art computer vision techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and object detection algorithms, to analyze video feeds from traffic cameras and identify helmet rule violations among motorcyclists, achieving an mAP score of 0.526.</li>
                            <li>Authored a research paper detailing the project's methodology, results, and implications, which has been published, contributing to the field of computer vision and traffic safety.</li>
                        </ul>
